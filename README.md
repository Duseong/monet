## Introductin to the Chemical Transport Model Verification

* Welcome to the arl_verify wiki!

This is the start to an ARL verification package. Currently, it handles CMAQ 4.7.1+, EPA AQS surface data, EPA AIRNOW, and the IMPROVE Aerosol data network. It will compute statistics, make time series, spatial and scatter plots, and more!  

The ARL verification package is meant to be a one stop shop for quick verification and study of CMAQ data (in the future we will want to add more models such as HYSPLIT, NMMB, WRF-ARW, and NGGPS and observations such as NADP, iicart flight data, VIIRS, MODIS, GOES-R, etc).  

### WHATS NEW!!!!

* Interpolation routines now use pyresample KDTrees.  You have the option of nearest neighbor, custom method (1/r or 1/r**2 or what have you), or a guassian method for KDTrees.  This replaces the scipy.interpolate.griddata.  The result is more flexibility and about 800% speedup in interpolating model results to observations.
* Added a verify driver.  Currently, this is a rudimentary driver.  It only returns a verification object for one of the previous verification objects (verifiy_airnow, verify_aqs, verify_improve).  Updates to the WIKI will be coming shortly.  Stay tuned. 

### Basic tutorial for AIRNOW and AQS.  

Please refer to the [AQS Tutorial ](https://github.com/bakerbd/arl_verify/wiki/Compare-CMAQ-to-AQS) and [AIRNOW](https://github.com/bakerbd/arl_verify/wiki/Comparing-CMAQ-and-AirNow)

The function calls are nearly identical (except for retrieving and loading the network dataset the package is identical).  

### Compare more than one simulation to a surface network

Please refer to [Compare Two Simulation Tutorial](https://github.com/bakerbd/arl_verify/wiki/Comparing-two-CMAQ-Simulations-Plotting-Overlay-Example). Several examples of how to use the package are shown to make time series with two simulations during July 2016 of NAQFC and NAQFC-Beta.

### Make Spatial Plots

Please refer to [Make Spatial Plot tutorial](https://github.com/bakerbd/arl_verify/wiki/Creating-Spatial-Plots-from-AIRNOW-and-CMAQ) for an example of how to make a spatial plot and overlay the surface monitor data.
