## Introduction to the Model and ObservatioN Evaluation Toolkit (MONET)

Please read the docs at [ReadTheDocs](https://monet-arl.readthedocs.io)

This is the start to an MONET verification package. Currently, it handles CMAQ 4.7.1+, EPA AQS surface data, EPA AirNow, and the IMPROVE Aerosol data network. Current effort is being added to add in the ASOS network, the Climate Reference Network, sonde data and more. It will compute statistics, make time series, spatial and scatter plots, and more!

Please refer to the [publication](http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/8/11/210) and the [ReadTheDocs](https://monet-arl.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) for more detail.

### Note for data I/O

Note that as of version 2.1.5 MONET has been split into two repositories, MONET and MONETIO. This was done to simplify the build process for each repository and allow each to develop independently.
